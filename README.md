Short, 3 level 2D platformer
This game is a platformer where you find keys, avoid enemies, and get to the goal. 

## Implementation
3 levels
Keys and Locks using tilemaps
Snail enemy that uses raycasts
Bat enemy that uses Navigation2D
Pause, victory, start menus
Changed a bit of the character code to make it more responsive. (I'm honestly not a fan of the character controller used in the tutorials, the charge jump, coyote time implementation, and "Moving and Jumping" are all finnicky.

New assets created by myself made in Aseprite. I went with a black and white theme, with "good" things, such the player and keys, having a rainbow color
